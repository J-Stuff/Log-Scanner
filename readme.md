How to use:

**NEW! You can now run the program with the pre-compiled EXE file, No need to install python!**

Execute the script by running the  `run.bat` file. Then, copy-paste or drag the link to the player.log file into the cmd window. The script will do it's magic from there.

NOTE:
The script grabs data from a github repo to ensure that the translations, triggers & script itself stay up-to-date. This happens every 48 hours when the script is run.
If you need to make the script update on next execution, change the "lastUpdated" value in resources > dataStore.json to 0.
*This script can utilize a module that allows it to send anonymous data about what errors it finds in the player logs.*
*All data sent is completely anonymous (it does NOT include IP Addresses, any HWID Identifiers, Discord Account information or simmilar) and is encrypted in transit. As well as stored in a secure and encrypted manner.*
